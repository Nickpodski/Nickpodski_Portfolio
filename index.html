          Hello, My name is Nicholas Podniestrzanski, but I go by Nick. I've been working for company 
          called Proforma since August of 2021. Which I started at shortly after finishing my bootcamp
          June of 2021 at UCF. I was hired there to be a Full Stack Web Developeer, but they needed help 
          with their QA Automation. Some vacancies left me as the senior member on that team so I've been
          on it ever since. October of 2022 I became the team lead, and have been pushing the transition
          to Xunit from MS.Test a long with catching the team up to best practices. I'm currently looking for my
          oppurtunity in my Tech Career!
        <p class="flow-text">
          In February of 2012 I graduated from Full Sail University with a Bachelor's Degree in Film.
          I got a job a at ESPN a few months later. I worked there Freelance for a view years. I worked
          various freelance jobs for the past 8 years, but in 2014 I started freelance at Golf Channel.
          I've worked at Golf channel as my primary Job for nearly 7 years. This year they decided to
          do a company move to Stamford, CT. I didn't make the move with them, and decided to get back
          into coding.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          Over the years I've done various video productions jobs including; Directing, Producing,
          Video Editing, Live Video Editing, Camera Operation, Live Directing/Producing, and various
          other video produciton jobs. My hightlight of my career was being credited as a Producer for
          the early coverage of <a href="https://www.theopen.com/" target="_blank">2019 The Open</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          My early years of programming and coding has aided in my quest to become a Full Stack Web
          Developer. And now that I've got some actual professional experience in coding I'm ever confident of my
          coding abilties! Hopefulyy my vast experiences can continue to help me alon in this Career!
