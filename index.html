                    Hello, My name is Nicholas Podniestrzanski, but I go by Nick. I'm currently taking a Coding Bootcamp
                    from UCF. I've been working in the Video and Television broadcasting industries for the past 8 years.
                    I've recently decided to get back into coding. Before I decided to go to film school I was very much on
                    a path for computer programming. Then I decided to go to film school!
								
									<p>
                    In February of 2012 I graduated from Full Sail University with a Bachelor's Degree in Film. 
                    I got a job a at ESPN a few months later. I worked there Freelance for a view years. I worked
                    various freelance jobs for the past 8 years, but in 2014 I started freelance at Golf Channel.
                    I've worked at Golf channel as my primary Job for nearly 7 years. This year they decided to
                    do a company move to Stamford, CT. I didn't make the move with them, and decided to get back
                    into coding.
									</p>
								
									<p>
                    Over the years I've done various video productions jobs including; Directing, Producing,
                    Video Editing, Live Video Editing, Camera Operation, Live Directing/Producing, and various
                    other video produciton jobs. My hightlight of my career was being credited as a Producer for
                    the early coverage of <a href="https://www.theopen.com/" target="_blank">2019 The Open</a>. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    My early years of programming and coding has aided in my quest to become a Full Stack Web
                    Developer. And hopefully at the end of this bootcamp I will begin my new career, and my past
                    experiences will give me an edge.
                  </p>
