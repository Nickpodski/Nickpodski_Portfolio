          Hello, My name is Nicholas Podniestrzanski, but I go by Nick. I'm currently taking a Coding Bootcamp
          from UCF. I've been working in the Video and Television broadcasting industries for the past 8 years.
          I've recently decided to get back into coding. Before I decided to go to film school I was very much on
          a path for computer programming. Then I decided to go to film school!
        <p class="flow-text">
          In February of 2012 I graduated from Full Sail University with a Bachelor's Degree in Film.
          I got a job a at ESPN a few months later. I worked there Freelance for a view years. I worked
          various freelance jobs for the past 8 years, but in 2014 I started freelance at Golf Channel.
          I've worked at Golf channel as my primary Job for nearly 7 years. This year they decided to
          do a company move to Stamford, CT. I didn't make the move with them, and decided to get back
          into coding.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          Over the years I've done various video productions jobs including; Directing, Producing,
          Video Editing, Live Video Editing, Camera Operation, Live Directing/Producing, and various
          other video produciton jobs. My hightlight of my career was being credited as a Producer for
          the early coverage of <a href="https://www.theopen.com/" target="_blank">2019 The Open</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          My early years of programming and coding has aided in my quest to become a Full Stack Web
          Developer. And hopefully at the end of this bootcamp I will begin my new career, and my past
          experiences will give me an edge.
