# Nickpodski_Portfolio

## Description

This is my first portfolio website which is a part of my coding bootcamp homework. We were practing using Bootstrap as a predfined CSS. We had a general structure to meet. It has 3 pages which are a About Me, Portfolio page, and Contact page. The contact page does't currently do anything. This was merely practicing using Bootstrap to layout my portfolio for future use.
